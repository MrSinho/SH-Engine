<p>For some computer graphics definitions check this <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_computer_graphics">wikipedia link</a>.
The best resource for reading about vulkan specific functions and structure definitions is <a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/man/html/">this</a>.</p>
<h2 id="vkapplicationinfo">VkApplicationInfo:</h2>
<p>Defines stuff like your application name, the application version, the engine name with its version and the Vulkan API version.</p>
<h2 id="validation-layers-and-message-callbacks">Validation layers and message callbacks</h2>
<p>Vulkan libraries have no debug tools by default, which could lead to unexpected errors and bugs for the developer. That's why you can use validation layers, which consist in some checks and conditions before a function is called. You can develop your own validation layer, or you can ask Vulkan to use some you've already installed with the Vulkan SDK,, such as <code>VK_LAYER_KHRONOS_validation</code>. With <code>vkEnumerateInstanceLayerProperties</code> you get an array of the installed validation layers, which properties are stored in the <code>VkLayerProperties</code> structure.</p>
<p>Validation layers work only when you're manipulating CPU data, that's why for GPU debugging you should setup a debug messenger callback: --</p>
<h2 id="vkinstance-and-instance-extensions">VkInstance and instance extensions</h2>
<p>A VkInstance is what is the intermediate component between yout program and Vulkan. To create an instance you first need to setup a <code>VkInstanceCreateInfo</code> structure which holds the <code>VkApplicationInfo</code>, the name and number of the validation layers you want to use, and the instance extensions. In the future you're going to create a <a href="#Header">swapchain</a>, which you'll be able to use only by enabling</p>

<p>Which requires the following data:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>minImageCount</code>: which is the minimum number of required images to present. A standard way is to use the same number of minImageCount the surface capabilities (<code>vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR</code>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(accessible with <code>vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceCapabilitiesKHR</code>) image <code>width</code>, <code>height</code> and <code>preTransform</code>, which consist in some <a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/man/html/VkSurfaceTransformFlagBitsKHR.html">transformation</a> you can make to images before the presentation, it's an easy to understand operation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><a href="https://www.khronos.org/registry/vulkan/specs/1.2-extensions/man/html/VkFormat.html">image format</a> (specifies color space, bitdepth, components type and the way data is stored) (the supported formats can be found with <code>vkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfaceFormatsKHR</code>). A common implementation of the format in the swapchain is to look for a specific format (for instance <code>VK_FORMAT_B8G8R8A8_UNORM</code>), and in case these formats have not been found you set it to <code>VK_FORMAT_UNDEFINED</code>, which means that you don't want to specify which format you're going to use. The way used to define formats is the following:
<code>VK_FORMAT</code> + <code>COLOR_COMPONENT_WITH_BIT_SIZE</code> * <code>N_COMPONENTS</code> + <code>VALUES_TYPE</code>. Some common types are: <code>UNORM</code> (the color vector with unsigned components is normalized), <code>SNORM</code> (the color vector with signed components is normalized), <code>USCALED</code> (the components are unsigned scaled integers), <code>SSCALED</code> (the components are signed scaled integers), <code>UINT</code> (the color components are unsigned integers), <code>SINT</code> (the color components are signed integers), <code>UFLOAT</code> (unsigned floats), <code>SFLOAT</code> (signed floats), <code>SRGB</code> (unsigned and normalized vector that is handled with sRGB nonlinear encoding).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is means that according to Khronos:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><code>VK_FORMAT_B8G8R8A8_UNORM</code> specifies a four-component, 32-bit unsigned normalized format that has an 8-bit B component in byte 0, an 8-bit G component in byte 1, an 8-bit R component in byte 2, and an 8-bit A component in byte 3.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>
<p>present mode (the supported present modes can be enumerated with <code>VkGetPhysicalDeviceSurfacePresentModesKHR</code>), which means how the swapchain is going to present the images to the screen:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>With <code>VK_PRESENT_MODE_IMMEDIATE_KHR</code> the images submitted to the application are presented on the screen the instant they're ready</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>VK_PRESENT_MODE_FIFO_KHR</code> the ready-to-use image is submitted to a queue</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>using VK_PRESENT_MODE_FIFO_RELAXED_KHR the image is not submitted to a queue when the queue is empty</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>VK_PRESENT_MODE_MAILBOX_KHR</code> replaces the old images with newer ones in case the queue is full, instead of blocking the application such as in <code>VK_PRESENT_MODE_FIFO_KHR</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>composite alpha: consists on how the alpha value is handled by the swapchain:</p>
<ul>
<li>VK_COMPOSITE_ALPHA_OPAQUE_BIT_KHR: ignore alpha value, the image is always opaque</li>
<li>VK_COMPOSITE_ALPHA_PRE_MULTIPLIED_BIT_KHR:</li>
<li>VK_COMPOSITE_ALPHA_POST_MULTIPLIED_BIT_KHR:</li>
<li>VK_COMPOSITE_ALPHA_INHERIT_BIT_KHR:</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>image array layers</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>if clipped</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the image color space</p>
</li>
</ul>
